# Object Oriented Programming II

Tuesday 3/9/21

Project: Adventure Game II (Github link goes here)

## Inheritance

- One class can be an instance of another class
- parent/child classes, child can add function to the parent
- child classes contain more detail

## Composition

- If one class is composed of another class, can't exist on its own
- less closely related: a restaurant has an employee. The employee still exists if there's no restaurant.

## Python for Dummies

(my notes on learning the language coming from Javascript)

Using vscode:

- to run a program, ctrl + shift + p: run python file in terminal
- It opens another terminal you can access from dropdown, bash stays separate
- cd into folder where the program is
- python filename.py runs the file
- up arrow recalls last command

## Stuff I Googled

- check if something is in an array: if x in arr (well that's straightforward).
- lowercase syntax: StringContent.lower()
- python dictionary syntax: w3schools, looks a lot like a js object. Can separate with returns for readability.
- triplequotes in python: used for a multi-line string
